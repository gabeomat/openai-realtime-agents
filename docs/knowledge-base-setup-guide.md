# Knowledge Base Setup Guide for Mike's Digital Twin

## Overview
This guide explains how to populate the knowledge base with Mike's actual content from his book and course to create an authentic digital twin coach.

## Current Structure

The knowledge base is set up with placeholder content that needs to be replaced with Mike's actual IP:

```
/src/knowledge/
├── index.ts              # Main knowledge base interface
├── book/
│   └── index.ts         # Book content structure (needs Mike's content)
├── course/
│   └── index.ts         # Course content structure (needs Mike's content)
└── knowledgeTools.ts    # Tools for accessing the knowledge base
```

## Step-by-Step Setup Process

### 1. **Prepare Mike's Book Content**

**What you need:**
- Digital copy of Mike's book (PDF, Word doc, or text)
- Chapter breakdown
- Key concepts and frameworks
- Personal stories and anecdotes
- Exercises and actionable content

**How to add it:**
1. Open `/src/knowledge/book/index.ts`
2. Replace placeholder content in:
   - `bookChunks` - Main content broken into searchable chunks
   - `bookConcepts` - Key concepts and definitions
   - `bookStories` - Personal stories with lessons
   - `bookExercises` - Actionable exercises

**Content Chunking Strategy:**
- Break content into 200-500 word chunks
- Each chunk should cover one main idea
- Include relevant keywords for searchability
- Maintain context and source references

### 2. **Prepare Mike's Course Content**

**What you need:**
- Course modules and lessons
- Video transcripts (if applicable)
- Course exercises and assignments
- Frameworks and methodologies
- Student outcomes and case studies

**How to add it:**
1. Open `/src/knowledge/course/index.ts`
2. Replace placeholder content in:
   - `courseChunks` - Main course content
   - `courseModules` - Module structure and lessons
   - `courseExercises` - Assignments and activities
   - `courseFrameworks` - Mike's methodologies

### 3. **Content Processing Tips**

#### **For Book Content:**
```typescript
// Example of properly formatted book chunk
{
  id: "book-ch3-mindset-001",
  content: "Mike's actual content about mindset from chapter 3...",
  source: "book",
  chapter: "Chapter 3: The Underdog Mindset",
  topic: "mindset",
  framework: "underdog-mindset",
  keywords: ["mindset", "underdog", "belief", "resilience"],
  confidence: 1.0
}
```

#### **For Course Content:**
```typescript
// Example of properly formatted course chunk
{
  id: "course-mod2-goals-001", 
  content: "Mike's specific goal-setting methodology from module 2...",
  source: "course",
  module: "Module 2: Goal Setting",
  topic: "goal-setting",
  framework: "mike-goal-method",
  keywords: ["goals", "planning", "belief", "action"],
  confidence: 1.0
}
```

### 4. **Quality Assurance Checklist**

Before going live, ensure:
- [ ] All placeholder content is replaced with Mike's actual content
- [ ] Content chunks are properly categorized by topic and framework
- [ ] Keywords are relevant and searchable
- [ ] Personal stories include the actual lesson/takeaway
- [ ] Frameworks are Mike's specific methodologies, not generic ones
- [ ] All content is verified as Mike's IP
- [ ] Confidence scores reflect content accuracy

### 5. **Testing the Knowledge Base**

**Test Queries to Try:**
- "What does Mike say about goal setting?"
- "Tell me Mike's story about being underestimated"
- "What is Mike's framework for building belief?"
- "How does Mike handle setbacks?"
- "What exercises does Mike recommend for mindset?"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Agent should only reference Mike's specific content
- Responses should include source attribution
- Out-of-scope questions should be redirected
- Personal stories should be Mike's actual experiences

### 6. **Ongoing Maintenance**

**Regular Updates:**
- Add new content as Mike creates it
- Refine keywords based on user queries
- Update confidence scores based on user feedback
- Monitor for scope creep (non-Mike content)

**Performance Monitoring:**
- Track which content gets accessed most
- Identify gaps in the knowledge base
- Monitor user satisfaction with responses
- Refine search algorithms based on usage

## Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)

### **Vector Search Integration**
For larger content volumes, consider adding:
- Embedding generation for semantic search
- Vector database integration (Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Improved content retrieval accuracy

### **Content Versioning**
- Track changes to Mike's content over time
- A/B test different content presentations
- Maintain content history and updates

### **Analytics Dashboard**
- Monitor knowledge base usage
- Track most popular topics and frameworks
- Identify content gaps and opportunities

## Security and IP Protection

**Important Considerations:**
- Ensure all content is properly licensed for use
- Implement access controls if needed
- Monitor for unauthorized content sharing
- Regular audits of agent responses

## Getting Started

1. **Immediate Action**: Replace placeholder content in `/src/knowledge/book/index.ts` with Mike's actual book content
2. **Next Step**: Add course content to `/src/knowledge/course/index.ts`
3. **Test**: Run the agent and test with Mike's specific topics
4. **Refine**: Adjust based on response quality and accuracy

The knowledge base is designed to be Mike's authentic voice and methodology - the quality of the digital twin depends entirely on the quality and completeness of the content you add.
